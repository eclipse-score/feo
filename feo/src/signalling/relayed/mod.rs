//! Relayed signalling module
//!
//! This module provides variants of relayed signalling.
//! In a relayed signalling setup, different communication channels are used for inter-process
//! and intra-process communication. Every secondary agent (or recorder) uses two inter-process
//! channels for sending and receiving signals to or from the primary agent. Two relay threads
//! in each agent are used to transfer signals between inter- and intra-process channels. In the
//! secondary agents, each worker thread is attached to the respective relays by means of two
//! intra-process connections. In the primary agent, workers are connected directly to the
//! through intra-process channels.
